# Here is the deepstream_python code.
## If you are going to make changes make a new branch or I will think your code is nvidias base code.

The main repository for the deepstream python code is the file is
ds_trafficcamnet.py

this file depends on ds_trafficcamtest_config.txt. It is not expected for edits to happen to the _config.txt. 

The other code files are being used a reference because they are example codes provided from Nvidia. Take a look to get an idea of what they are doing.

ds_trafficcamnet.py is not in a run ready state and is still being configured for the proper settings.
